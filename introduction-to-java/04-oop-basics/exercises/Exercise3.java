/**
 * Exercise 3: Student and Course System
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Create a Student class with the following attributes:
 *    - id (String)
 *    - name (String)
 *    - courses (array of Course objects)
 * 
 * 2. Create a Course class with the following attributes:
 *    - code (String)
 *    - title (String)
 *    - instructor (String)
 *    - maxCapacity (int)
 *    - enrolledStudents (array of Student objects)
 * 
 * 3. Implement the following methods in the Student class:
 *    - Constructor to initialize id and name
 *    - enrollInCourse(Course course) - Adds a course to the student's courses
 *    - dropCourse(Course course) - Removes a course from the student's courses
 *    - displayCourses() - Prints all courses the student is enrolled in
 * 
 * 4. Implement the following methods in the Course class:
 *    - Constructor to initialize code, title, instructor, and maxCapacity
 *    - addStudent(Student student) - Adds a student to the course (if not at capacity)
 *    - removeStudent(Student student) - Removes a student from the course
 *    - displayStudents() - Prints all students enrolled in the course
 * 
 * 5. In the main method:
 *    - Create several Student and Course objects
 *    - Enroll students in courses
 *    - Display course rosters and student schedules
 *    - Test edge cases (e.g., course at capacity, dropping a course)

/**
 * Exercise 1: Student Management System
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Create a Student class with the following attributes:
 *    - id (String)
 *    - name (String)
 *    - age (int)
 *    - grade (double)
 * 
 * 2. Implement the following methods in the Student class:
 *    - Constructor to initialize all attributes
 *    - Getters and setters for all attributes
 *    - toString() method to display student information
 *    - equals() and hashCode() methods based on the student id
 * 
 * 3. Create a StudentManager class that uses an ArrayList to store Student objects and
 *    implements the following functionality:
 *    - addStudent(Student student): Adds a student to the list
 *    - removeStudent(String id): Removes a student with the given id
 *    - findStudent(String id): Finds and returns a student with the given id
 *    - getAllStudents(): Returns a list of all students
 *    - getStudentsByAgeRange(int minAge, int maxAge): Returns a list of students within the age range
 *    - getStudentsByGradeRange(double minGrade, double maxGrade): Returns a list of students within the grade range
 *    - getAverageGrade(): Returns the average grade of all students
 *    - getTopPerformingStudents(int n): Returns the top n students by grade
 *    - sortStudentsByName(): Returns a list of students sorted by name
 *    - sortStudentsByGrade(): Returns a list of students sorted by grade (descending)
 * 
 * 4. Create a StudentManagementSystem class with a main method that:
 *    - Creates a StudentManager
 *    - Adds at least 10 students with different attributes
 *    - Demonstrates all the functionality of the StudentManager
 *    - Provides a simple menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the system
 * 
 * 5. Implement proper exception handling for all operations
 * 
 * 6. Use appropriate List methods and Java 8+ features (like streams, lambda expressions)
 *    where applicable

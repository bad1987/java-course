/**
 * Exercise 4: Library Management System with Packages
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Create a package structure for a library management system:
 *    - com.library.model: for entity classes
 *    - com.library.service: for service classes
 *    - com.library.util: for utility classes
 * 
 * 2. In the com.library.model package, create the following classes:
 *    - Book: with properties title, author, isbn, available
 *    - Member: with properties id, name, borrowedBooks (array of Book)
 *    - Library: with properties name, books (array of Book), members (array of Member)
 * 
 * 3. In the com.library.service package, create the following classes:
 *    - BookService: with methods to add, find, and display books
 *    - MemberService: with methods to register, find, and display members
 *    - BorrowingService: with methods to borrow and return books
 * 
 * 4. In the com.library.util package, create the following classes:
 *    - DateUtils: with methods to format and parse dates
 *    - ValidationUtils: with methods to validate input data
 *    - Constants: with constants used throughout the system
 * 
 * 5. Create a main class (LibraryManagementSystem) that:
 *    - Creates a library with books and members
 *    - Performs various operations (add books, register members, borrow/return books)
 *    - Displays the library status
 * 
 * Note: For this exercise, you can simulate the package structure with comments
 * and include all classes in this file. In a real project, each class would be
 * in its own file within the appropriate package directory.

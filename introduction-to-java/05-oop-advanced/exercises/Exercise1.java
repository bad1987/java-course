/**
 * Exercise 1: Shape Hierarchy
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Create an abstract class called Shape with the following:
 *    - Abstract methods: calculateArea(), calculatePerimeter(), and draw()
 *    - Concrete method: displayInfo() that prints information about the shape
 * 
 * 2. Create the following concrete subclasses of Shape:
 *    - Circle: with radius as a property
 *    - Rectangle: with length and width as properties
 *    - Triangle: with base and height as properties
 * 
 * 3. Implement all required methods in each subclass:
 *    - calculateArea(): returns the area of the shape
 *    - calculatePerimeter(): returns the perimeter of the shape
 *    - draw(): prints a message about drawing the shape
 * 
 * 4. Create a ShapeProcessor class with the following static methods:
 *    - printShapeDetails(Shape shape): displays all details about a shape
 *    - getTotalArea(Shape[] shapes): calculates the sum of all shapes' areas
 *    - findLargestShape(Shape[] shapes): returns the shape with the largest area
 * 
 * 5. In the main method:
 *    - Create at least one instance of each shape type
 *    - Store them in an array of Shape references
 *    - Use the ShapeProcessor methods to display information about the shapes
 *    - Demonstrate polymorphism by calling methods on different shape types
